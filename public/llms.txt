# Pow.fyi

> Pow.fyi is a free, open-source Progressive Web App providing ski resort snow forecasts for North America. It is a client-side React SPA with no backend — all weather data is fetched directly from public APIs in the browser. It serves as an alternative to OpenSnow and Snow-Forecast.

Pow.fyi uses a multi-step snowfall accuracy pipeline rather than showing raw API numbers:

1. **Multi-model averaging** — Fetches 3 weather models in parallel from Open-Meteo (US: GFS + ECMWF + HRRR; Canada: GFS + ECMWF + GEM). Precipitation uses the median; temperature and wind use the mean.
2. **Variable snow-liquid ratio (SLR)** — Recalculates snowfall from total precipitation using a temperature-dependent SLR (10:1 at 0°C up to 20:1 below −15°C), adjusted for humidity and wind speed.
3. **Freezing level rain/snow split** — Re-splits precipitation using station elevation vs. freezing level height.
4. **NWS cross-reference (US only)** — Blends NWS Weather.gov forecaster-adjusted snowfall amounts (30% NWS / 70% model).

Key features:

- 100+ curated North American ski resorts (US and Canada) with metadata (elevation, vertical drop, lifts, acres, coordinates)
- 7-day forecast with snow, rain, high/low temperatures, feels-like, UV index, and freezing altitude
- Toggle between Base, Mid, and Top elevation forecasts
- Hourly detail charts (72 hours) for temperature, precipitation, wind, and snow
- Snow timeline combining 14-day past + 7-day future snowfall
- Favorite resorts saved locally on device
- Imperial/Metric unit toggle and timezone picker (13 NA zones + UTC)
- Installable PWA with offline app shell support

Routes:

- `/` — Home page: searchable resort catalog grouped by region with favorites section
- `/resort/{slug}` — Resort detail page with forecast, charts, conditions, and snow timeline (e.g. `/resort/vail-co`, `/resort/whistler-blackcomb-bc`)

Tech stack: React 19, TypeScript, Vite 6 (Bun), Apache ECharts 6, react-router-dom v7, vite-plugin-pwa + Workbox, vanilla CSS (dark theme, responsive), hosted on Azure Static Web Apps.
